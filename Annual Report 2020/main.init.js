So, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the closure of school buildings across Ontario in March 2020, Greenwood was ready to meet this new reality head on.The schools staff, with the guidance of the Senior Leadership Team, has done an excellent job of responding to the challenges posed by COVID-19. They pivoted quickly and seamlessly to online learning in March while also finding ways to build and maintain community in a virtual environment. Similarly, Greenwood students and parents adapted admirably to online learning. While the last few months of the 2019-2020 school year were far from easy, I am immensely proud of the Greenwood communitys willingness to rise to the occasion.Even in what was a highly unusual year, Greenwood also continued to make progress on its strategic goals. Important work done over the 2019-2020 year included: connecting diversity, equity and inclusion work to the Adviser program and to the classroom; further increasing health and well-being supports; and providing exceptional professional development opportunities for teachers at all stages of their careers. More information on our Strategic Plan progress is available on the following pages.Greenwood also made significant progress on developing its next strategic plan. The school worked with Level5 Strategy throughout the year to gather feedback from students, staff, parents and alumni and to research best practices from educational institutions around the world. This information will be used to develop our 2021-2026 Strategic Plan, which will launch before the next school year begins.As always,I am deeply grateful for the financial support from current and past parents, grandparents, alumni, staff and friends that enables Greenwood to continue to innovate and to drive the schools mission and strategic plan forward.My sincere thanks also go to Greenwoods principal, Sarah Bruce, and to our staff, for their tireless efforts and dedication to the school in a very demanding year. I would also like to thank our volunteers and Board of Directors for giving generously of their time and expertise.No matter what the future holds, I am confident that Greenwood is up to the challenge.Donald LewtasChair, Greenwood College School Board of DirectorsGreenwood Annual Report 2019/2020 2'", "3": "b'PRINCIPALS MESSAGE SARAH BRUCEThe 2019-2020 school year was our fourth under the guidance of our current strategic plan. The plan was developed with the goal of enhancing Greenwoods ability to provide a customized learning experience for students and encouraging the building of character and community. Six priorities for Greenwood over the coming years were identified; I am happy to report on our ongoing progress in all of these areas.1 Invest in the Greenwood Centre for Teaching and Learning2019-2020 brought more evidence that teachers are embracing a coaching approach to their teaching. Each teacher is asked to develop goals based on the academic and community focus for the year and to set clear goals for student learning. This approach has resulted in high engagement and collaboration among teachers. Teachers who have been at the school for seven years or more once again had the opportunity to explore a research question throughout the year that deepens their expertise and their focus on student learning. Our Teaching and Learning resource website was also further enhanced with new modules and resources. When the school moved online in March, Mary Gauthier, the Centres Executive Director, and Heather Maxted, Expert Teacher, conducted classroom observations and surveyed teachers about what was working in the online model and where more support was needed. Mary also worked with the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education and the Canadian Coaching Centre to offer a webinar series entitled Developing a Coaching Culture in Schools, which featured many Greenwood staff members as guest speakers.Greenwood Annual Report 2019/2020 3'", "4": "b'2 Manage the Transitionto Our New CampusThe 2019-2020 school year was our fourth in our expanded and renovated facility. Though we have settled into the building, we continue to review our spaces and look for ways to enhance their use. Having noticed that many students were using the caf for grab and go items, we added an express caf to the second floor common area to distribute lunchtime traffic more widely. We completed Phase 2 of our Innovation Lab renovation for September 2019, allowing for classes to be held in the space and introducing more new technology. Our South Gym was enhanced with a Grizzly door wrap, and additional teams (such as a second U14 Boys Basketball team) were added to allow for more athletics participation and to take advantage of our increased gym space. We also upgraded our Staff Lounge with new furniture, softer lighting and a decorative wall installation.3 Address the Changing Needs of Students Across the GradesA major priority in 2019-2020 was weaving diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) concepts into the classroom. Our Summer Institute DEI Team developed programming and resources that teachers implemented across all subjects. All grades focused on building empathy and inclusion, and teachers worked with students to unpack and understand critical current events. Our Literacy Coordinator conducted literacy assessments within English classes for Grade 7-9 students; she then oversaw differentiated intervention to support literacy development as needed. We also ensured that new students integrating into Grade 7 and Grade 9 received support through this transition. Our Age and Stage framework, which was fully implemented in 2018-2019, continued to help teachers target their lesson delivery to each grades unique needs. When learning moved online in March in response to COVID-19, teachers worked tirelessly to strengthen community in the classroom and ensure that students felt connected to their teachers and to each other.Greenwood Annual Report 2019/2020 4'", "5": "b'4 Enhance our StudentAdviser ProgramOur Summer Institute DEI team also developed programming for our Adviser program, which was incorporated throughout 2019-2020. Key themes included Identity, Allyship and Courageous Conversations. Well-being practices and strategies continued to be a focus in Adviser; when learning moved online in March, the focus of this program shifted largely to well-being and community building. Advisers used their sessions to create a safe, inclusive and caring environment for students in a time of change and uncertainty. Half of our Grade 7 students completed the Hi Five for Life program through Adviser, which empowers students to think critically about their lifestyle choices. (COVID-19 unfortunately impacted the delivery of this program to the second half of our Grade 7 students.) In Grades 9-12, Advisers used coaching conversations as a way to encourage students academic and character growth. This approach helped Advisers customize the conversations they have with their Advisees and provide individualized next steps. To make the Adviser report process more student-centred, the June 2020 report implemented a student comment section where students reflected on how they grew in 2019-2020 and set goals for the following year.Greenwood Annual Report 2019/2020 5'", "6": "b'5 Educate our Communityon the Core Principlesof Well-BeingThough well-being is always a focus at Greenwood, our focus on this area became especially critical when COVID-19 forced the closure of our school building in March. Our teachers were attuned to students needs throughout the closure, adapting lesson delivery as necessary. Well-being activities such as mindful moments, activity breaks and brain breaks, already part of our class structure, were used much more frequently during this time; teachers were mindful of the need to model self-care. We also offered four school-wide Well-being Wednesday sessions in April and May; students could participate in sessions run by teachers such as baking, trivia or pilates, or use the day to recharge away from their screen. Aside from these initiatives, we made many other strides in well-being this year. We again increased the availability of our school social worker, Lori Houzer, enabling her to counsel even more students. Many staff members completed Mental Health First Aid training, ensuring that they have the knowledge necessary to support those experiencing a mental health crisis. We continued to offer Boys and Girls Groups for Grades 7-11; these groups give students a structured, yet open, forum to discuss issues affecting girls and boys and to form and strengthen new friendships. Finally, we hired our first Director, Student Well-being, who started in her role in August of 2020.Greenwood Annual Report 2019/2020 6'", "7": "b'6 Create More Opportunitiesfor Graduates and Their Families to Stay Connected with GreenwoodThe 2019-2020 school year marked the first full year for Greenwoods Alumni Executive. The team made significant progress toward laying the foundation for a strong alumni community. Key initiatives this year included the launch of our Internship and Mentorship Pairing Program and our Instagram Live Event Series, which took the place of our May 2020 Alumni Reunion due to COVID-19. We welcomed our highest number of alumni speakers ever for our annual Careers Morning, and our WinterGreen event, hosted by the Roundtable, was our most well-attended of all time. During the school closure, we offered online sessions by Dr. David Tranter about self care and by Dr. Robert Sargeant about COVID-19. As the closure precluded us from hosting our Graduation Ceremony in June, Greenwood students and staff made surprise visits to the homes of the Class of 2020 to congratulate them on this significant accomplishment.Greenwood Annual Report 2017/2019 7'", "8": "b'REVENUE AND EXPENSES:GREENWOOD COLLEGE SCHOOLREVENUE BREAKDOWN for the year ended June 30, 202091 %Fees3 % Contributions6 % Other RevenueEXPENSES BREAKDOWN for the year ended June 30, 2020STUDENT LEARNING AND PROGRAMS8 %Student Learning7 %Student Programs59 %Teacher Compensation2 %Information &Communications TechnologySUPPORT 2 %Administration & External Relations14 %Staff Compensation8 %FacilitiesGreenwood Annual Report 2017/2019 8'", "9": "b'FUNDRAISING REPORT:GREENWOOD COLLEGE SCHOOLAND GREENWOOD COLLEGE SCHOOL FOUNDATIONThis past year will undoubtedly goprevious years.
